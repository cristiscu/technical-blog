The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing information across autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. As BGP is mostly used over internet, it is essential to keep the network secure.

### Introduction 
BGP peers can be configured with MD5 algorithm (introduced in RFC 2385) which support routing authentication. When MD5 authentication is enabled, it computes an MD5 cryptographic hash over the TCP “pseudo header”, which includes the IP addresses used, the BGP packet carried in the TCP segment and a secret password. The resulting MD5 hash is then put in a TCP option in the TCP header and the packet is sent on its way. (The password isn’t transmitted.) The other side performs the same MD5 calculation and checks the result against the MD5 hash in the TCP header. If the two MD5 hashes are same, then we can be reasonably sure of two things:

1.	The sender of the packet also knows the secret password
2.	The TCP segment and its contents weren’t modified during transit
If any attacker sends spoofed TCP reset packets, the MD5 hash will be missing, or it will be incorrect. The router simply ignores those packets and the BGP session is unaffected.

### Overview
There are few steps that need to be performed to complete this activity. Such as, creating network topology, configure hostname, configure interface IP, Configure External Border Gateway Protocol (EBGP)between Site A & site B, configure MD5 authentication, verification, and troubleshooting.
### Topology

### Configuration
### Site A: 
`Router#conf t`

`Router(config-if)#hostname siteA`

`siteA(config)#interface gig0/0`

`siteA(config-if)#ip address 192.168.1.100 255.255.255.0`

`siteA(config)# no shut`

`siteA(config)#interface loopback 1`

`siteA(config-if)#ip address10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0`

`%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up`

`%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up`

`siteA(config-if)#router bgp 100`

`siteA(config-router)#neighbor 192.168.1.101 remote-as 200` 

`siteA(config-router)#%BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor 192.168.1.101 Up`

`siteA(config-router)#neighbor 192.168.1.101 password cisco123`

`siteA(config-router)#network 10.10.10.1 mask 255.255.255.0`

### Site B: 
`Router#conf t`

`Router(config)#hostname siteB`

`siteB(config-if)#ip address 192.168.1.101 255.255.255.0`

`siteB(config-if)#no shut`

`siteB(config)#interface loopback 1`

`siteB(config-if)#ip address 20.20.20.1 255.255.255.0`

`%LINK-5-CHANGED: Interface GigabitEthernet0/0, changed state to up`

`%LINEPROTO-5-UPDOWN: Line protocol on Interface GigabitEthernet0/0,` 

`changed state to up`

`siteB(config)#router bgp 200`

`siteB(config-router)#neighbor 192.168.1.100 remote-as 100`

`siteB(config-router)#%BGP-5-ADJCHANGE: neighbor 192.168.1.100 Up`

`siteB(config-router)#neighbor 192.168.1.101 password cisco123`

`siteB(config-router)#network 20.20.20.1 mask 255.255.255.0`


### Verification:-

When BGP is configured with MD5 & neighborship is formed, then it implies that authentication is working perfectly, otherwise neighborship won’t be formed & you will be able to ping another end network.

`!!!!!`
`Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 0/0/1 ms`

`!!!!!`
`Success rate is 100 percent (5/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 0/0/1 ms`

### Troubleshooting:-

Peering succeeds only if both routers are configured for authentication and have the same password.
If a router has a password configured for a neighbor, but the neighbor router does not, then the following message is  displayed on the console while the routers attempt to establish a BGP session between them:

### `%TCP-6-BADAUTH: No MD5 digest from [peer's IP address]:11003 to`
` [local router's IP address]:179`

Similarly, if the two routers have different passwords configured, the following message will pop on the screen:

`%TCP-6-BADAUTH: Invalid MD5 digest from [peer's IP`
 `address]:11004 to [local router's IP address]`

### _Conclusion_ 
By following the above steps, you can easily configure BGP with the MD5 authentication. 
However, you should always implement other security & compliance mechanism as a layered structure to strengthen the overall network security.
